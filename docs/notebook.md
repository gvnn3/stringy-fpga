# Laboratory Notebook — stringy-fpga

Experiments on accelerating string matching and regex operations using the
dynamic (partially reconfigurable) region of the attached FPGA.

**Conventions for this notebook** (these extend the standard /notebook format):

- Entries are kept in **reverse chronological order** — newest experiment first,
  immediately after the Table of Contents.
- Every entry title carries both a **date and a time stamp** in the form
  `DD Mon YYYY HH:MM:SS` recording when the experiment was written up.
- Anchor IDs include the time: `#dd-mon-yyyy-hhmmss`.
- Each entry follows the 5-section format: Hypothesis, How, Observations,
  Data analysis, Ideas for future experiments. Status tags `:complete:` or
  `:in_progress:` follow the title.
- Entries are separated by `---`.

# EXPERIMENT  4 Jul 2026 07:33:45 FPGA Platform Discovery :complete:

## 1. Hypothesis

What FPGA hardware is installed in this system, what shell/driver does it run,
and can its dynamic region host a regex-matching engine reachable from Python?

## 2. How

- **Equipment:** Intel C620-chipset x86_64 server, Ubuntu (Linux 6.8.0-124-generic)
- **Software:** lspci, lsmod, sysfs inspection (no FPGA vendor tools assumed)
- **Benchmarks:** none — discovery only

### Key commands

```bash
lspci -nn | grep -iE 'xilinx|altera|intel.*fpga'
lspci -k -s af:00.0; lspci -k -s af:00.1
lsmod | grep -iE 'xdma|qdma|onic|xocl|xrt'
ls /sys/class/net/
command -v vivado v++ xbutil
```

## 3. Observations

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| PCIe functions | **af:00.0** (10ee:903f), **af:00.1** (10ee:913f), subsystem 10ee:0007 |
| PCI class | Network controller |
| Kernel driver | **onic** (AMD/Xilinx OpenNIC) |
| Network interfaces | enp175s0f0, enp175s0f1 |
| FPGA char devices | none (`/dev/xdma*`, `/dev/qdma*` absent) |
| Vendor tools on PATH | none (vivado, v++, xbutil all missing) |

## 4. Data analysis

The card runs the **OpenNIC shell** (QDMA-based), which reserves a 250 MHz
user-plugin **dynamic region** for custom RTL — the natural home for a regex
engine. Offload from Python is feasible: patterns compiled to a programmable
automaton loaded into the plugin region, data moved via QDMA (once char-devs
are enabled) or raw Ethernet frames to the NIC function (usable today).
FPGA wins only for large corpora / streaming with pattern reuse; PCIe latency
makes CPU faster for short one-shot matches. Toolchain (Vivado) installation
is a prerequisite for any hardware build. Full design captured in
`specs/python-regex-offload.md` (R1–R61, AC-0-x…AC-3-x).

## 5. Ideas for future experiments

- Install Vivado + OpenNIC build flow; rebuild shell with a stub user plugin
- Enable QDMA char-devs and measure PCIe round-trip latency and DMA bandwidth
- Benchmark CPython `re` vs. `re2`/`hyperscan` on target corpora to set the
  offload break-even thresholds (AC targets in the spec)
- Prototype Phase 0 software-only shim (`fpga_re`) with CPython fallback
